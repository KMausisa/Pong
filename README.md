# Overview

For this project I wanted to explore the world of game development with Unity. 

The game that I wrote is a 2D classic ping pong game. The player will go against an AI in a game of pong.

I wanted to learn Unity and create a simple game to understand how to use the software.

Below is a link to my demo video:
